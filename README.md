WHERE TO FIND ME ⛅️
i am usually hanging out in spawn, cafe, or with my lovely partner <3

i have anxiety so it kinda freaks me out when ppl i don't know talk to me </3 so don't be surprised or hurt if i suddenly shut down a conversation/leave (especially if we don’t share interests and you randomly come up to me, i will most likely leave) its nothin personal against ya! i’m usually off tab so whisper if you need my attention, also, please try to not cover me! also also! i very rarely accept friend rq's from ppl i don't know so
dont be offended if i don't add you back i just . don't know you
